About the Sheffield Search and Rescue (SSAR) corpus:
This is a corpus of unscripted, goal-oriented, two-party spoken conversations which has been designed and collected as part of an ongoing research into extracting mission-critical information from Search and Rescue speech communications.

The SSAR corpus comprises about 12 hours of data from 96 conversations by 24 native speakers of British English with a southern accent.

Each conversation is about a collaborative task of exploring and estimating a simulated indoor environment. The task has carefully been designed to have a quantitative measure for the amount of exchanged information about the discourse subject.

SSAR includes different layers of annotations which should be of interest to researchers in a wide range of human/human conversation understanding as well as automatic speech recognition. It also provides an amount of data for analysis of multiple parallel conversations around a single subject.

s5: This is the current recommended recipe.
